Bitwig MIDI controller scripts by Warrior Bob

This is a repository of Bitwig controller scripting projects that I've set up for my own personal use, but if you've stumbled across it you're welcome to use any of them.


Usage
===
To use any of these scripts, put the contents of this repository inside a folder inside your Bitwig Studio Controller Scripts directory. I use "WB" but you can use whatever you want.

Mine (on OSX) looks like this:

~\Documents\Bitwig Studio\Controller Scripts\WB\

(and under that there are folders for each script, which contain the .js files)

Once the files are there, load up Bitwig Studio, and in Preferences -> Controllers, choose one of the scripts from the WB folder, and set your device ins/outs if they aren't already detected.
